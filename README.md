My project is a site for a fictional BBQ place in downtown louisville. It's a pretty simple design that mainly focuses on the menu.
Which would be the main attraction/selling point for this business. Therefore I made it the focal point of the page.  
I used JS and CSS to make the functioning hamburger button nav for mobile viewing. 
I originally tried using just flexbox to make and organize the menu but soon realized I'd have to use grid if I wanted everything to line up nice a neat so I used CSS grid to do so. 
I also used JS to validate the email of the newsletter form.
